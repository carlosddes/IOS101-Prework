App Idea
Food Wheel: One problem I always have is not being able to choose where to eat when I eat out. Food wheel is an app that will help a user choose a random place to eat at. The app will read the user's location and take in a radius to compile a list of places to eat at. The app will then add all the places onto a wheel. The user will tap to spin the wheel which will stop on the randomly selected place.
